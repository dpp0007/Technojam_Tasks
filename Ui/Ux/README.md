Working on this task was a valuable learning experience where I developed skills in asset creation, Figma plugins, animations, scroll behavior, and prototyping.
I faced challenges that encouraged creative thinking and highlighted the importance of collaboration and feedback in refining designs.
Moving forward, I aim to enhance the visual appeal, improve animations, add functional elements, and make designs more compact and informative.
I also plan to explore other design tools and gain a deeper understanding of typography.
My goal is to create visually appealing designs that deliver a seamless user experience while continuously learning and evolving as a designer.
