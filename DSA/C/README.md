## **Question :- 1**
-I have completed this question by useing concept of bionomial expainsion.
-Formula(ncr=n!/r!(n-r)!)
-Time complexity is O(n<sup>3</sup>) because I am calling recursive factorial function which has time compexity  of O(n)
-Space Complexity is O(n) because factorial function use stack space which has space compexity of O(n) and ther is no additonal data structure has been used.
-I haven't faced any major problem while solving this question.

## **Question :- 2**
-I have completed this qustion by useing concept similar to Fibonacci sequence.
-Time Complexity is O(n). The loops run the times of stairs are given . 
-Space complexity is O(1) because it's not useing any additional space to store.
-I have faced problem while logic building and for that I used video help from YT cuz i haven't gone deep into the world of DSA.

 ## **Question :- 4**
-I have compeleted this question by crating simple logic for aounting char from array.
-Overall Time complexitiy is O(n). Inner loop also run O(n) as it count no. times of character and the worst case while reversing the no. is O(log m) where m is the count value.
-Space complexity is O(1) as it uses the same array to store the value.
-I have faced problem in storing the char count if its exceeds 9 so i took help from yt and learned the concept.

## ** I have done only three qustion because currently I am learning DSA and my concepts aren't clear for those questions**
