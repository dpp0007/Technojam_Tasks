## **Question :- 1**
-I have completed this question by useing concept of bionomial expainsion.<br>
-Formula(ncr=n!/r!(n-r)!)<br>
-Time complexity is O(n<sup>3</sup>) because I am calling recursive factorial function which has time compexity  of O(n)<br>
-Space Complexity is O(n) because factorial function use stack space which has space compexity of O(n) and ther is no additonal data structure has been used.<br>
-I haven't faced any major problem while solving this question.<br>

## **Question :- 2**
-I have completed this qustion by useing concept similar to Fibonacci sequence.<br>
-Time Complexity is O(n). The loops run the times of stairs are given . <br>
-Space complexity is O(1) because it's not useing any additional space to store.<br>
-I have faced problem while logic building and for that I used video help from YT cuz i haven't gone deep into the world of DSA.<br>

 ## **Question :- 4**
-I have compeleted this question by crating simple logic for aounting char from array.<br>
-Overall Time complexitiy is O(n). Inner loop also run O(n) as it count no. times of character and the worst case while reversing the no. is O(log m) where m is the count value.<br>
-Space complexity is O(1) as it uses the same array to store the value.<br>
-I have faced problem in storing the char count if its exceeds 9 so i took help from yt and learned the concept.<br>

## **I have done only three qustion because currently I am learning DSA and my concepts aren't clear for those questions**
